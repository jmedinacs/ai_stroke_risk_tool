# 🧠 AI Stroke Risk Prediction Tool

This project simulates a clinical decision support system that estimates stroke risk using a machine learning ensemble. It was designed to demonstrate how **interpretable AI** can support early screening and proactive healthcare.

## 📌 Why This Project Matters

According to the CDC, someone in the U.S. experiences a stroke every 40 seconds. Early screening plays a critical role in reducing complications and improving outcomes — especially in underdiagnosed or at-risk populations.

This project explores how machine learning can help estimate stroke-like risk using basic health information, making early screening more accessible and scalable.

## 🧹 Cleaning Process

For the full cleaning, EDA, and modeling logs, please view the [**logs**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FsB1hhmC_nTjlGYU_96GUmwSr9y97NrgAw7h-C2clwM/edit?gid=1992881522#gid=1992881522).

Every model is only as good as its data — a thorough cleaning phase was essential to ensure accurate and reliable results. Standard cleaning steps such as text standardization, outlier detection, missing value imputation, and duplicate detection were performed.

The **major cleaning steps** include:

1. **Handling missing BMI values**  
   201 missing entries in the `bmi` column were imputed using the **median** (28.1) rather than the mean, due to strong right skew and outliers (max = 97.6). This helped preserve data integrity without inflating values.

2. **Removing extremely rare categories**  
   A single occurrence of `'other'` in the `gender` feature was removed to avoid introducing noise during encoding. This rare category offered no analytical value and could bias downstream models.

3. **Correcting binary feature interpretation**  
   During model evaluation, SHAP summaries revealed that `hypertension` and `heart_disease` were contributing very little to predictions — a result inconsistent with medical expectations. Further investigation showed that although these features were binary (0/1), they were not explicitly cast as categorical, causing the model to treat them as continuous variables after one-hot encoding.

   To address this, both features were manually cast to the `category` type before encoding. This ensured they were correctly treated as categorical features, allowing their predictive value to be recognized by the models.

## 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

EDA was conducted to uncover patterns, identify potential predictors of stroke, assess feature distributions, and evaluate data quality before modeling. The key findings and steps are summarized below:

---

### 🧮 Numeric Feature Analysis

- `age` was relatively uniformly distributed with notable clusters around ages 55–60 and 70–80.
- `avg_glucose_level` exhibited **strong right skew**, with most values between 80–110 but a long tail beyond 150. Transformation may be necessary for sensitive models.
- `bmi` was slightly skewed to the right but resembled a normal distribution centered around 25–30.

⚠️ No transformation was applied during this phase, but skew and outliers were noted for potential downstream impact.

---

### 📊 Categorical Feature Distribution

- Gender: 58.6% female, 41.4% male
- Ever Married: 65.6% yes, 34.4% no
- Work Type: Diverse distribution, with 57% in private sector, and <1% “never worked”
- Smoking Status: 30% unknown, making it a potentially unreliable standalone feature

These distributions informed how categories were grouped, encoded, or handled during modeling.

---

### 🧪 Feature Significance Testing (Target: Stroke)

**Categorical vs Stroke (Chi-Squared Test):**

Statistically significant associations (p < 0.05) were found between stroke and:
- `heart_disease`
- `hypertension`
- `ever_married`
- `work_type`
- `smoking_status`

**Continuous vs Stroke (Point-Biserial Correlation):**

All three continuous features were statistically significant:
- `age`: Strongest predictor
- `avg_glucose_level`: Moderate predictor
- `bmi`: Weak but significant

---

### ⚖️ Target Distribution & Class Imbalance

Only **4.87%** of observations represent stroke cases, confirming a **severe class imbalance**. This guided the decision to use SMOTE and later SMOTE Tomek to ensure model reliability and avoid bias toward the majority class.

---

### 🧠 Multicollinearity & Feature Redundancy

Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) was calculated for all encoded features. No variable exceeded a VIF of 5, indicating **no multicollinearity** that would distort model coefficients or interpretation.

---

### 🔍 SHAP-Inspired Correction (Post-EDA Discovery)

Although `heart_disease` and `hypertension` were statistically significant in the chi-squared test, **SHAP summaries** revealed they were not contributing meaningfully to model predictions.  
This prompted a deeper review, revealing that these features, although binary, were **not explicitly cast as categorical**, and were incorrectly treated as continuous after one-hot encoding.  
Both features were re-cast as `category` type prior to encoding, resulting in **restored predictive value** and improved model alignment with medical expectations.
