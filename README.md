# AI Stroke Risk Predictor

This project simulates a clinical decision support tool that uses machine learning to estimate stroke risk based on demographic and health-related features. It‚Äôs designed to demonstrate how interpretable AI can support proactive healthcare interventions.

> **Disclaimer:** This tool is for educational purposes only. It is not approved for clinical use and must not be used for diagnosis or treatment. Always consult a healthcare provider for medical advice.

## What It Does

- Predicts stroke-like patient profiles using a trained ensemble model (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, KNN)
- Accepts real-time patient inputs through a Streamlit web app
- Returns probability score, color-coded severity feedback, and clear recommendations
- Uses SHAP values for model explainability and transparency

---

## Key Features

- **Ensemble Modeling** ‚Äì Combines multiple classifiers via soft voting for better performance
- **One-Hot Encoded Features** ‚Äì Ensures proper handling of categorical patient inputs
- **Class Imbalance Handling** ‚Äì Uses SMOTE to balance stroke vs. non-stroke cases
- **Model Interpretability** ‚Äì SHAP summary plots and waterfall explanations
- **Streamlit Interface** ‚Äì User-friendly web tool with sliders and dropdowns

## Model Highlights

| Model                      | Precision | Recall | F1 Score | F2 Score | AUC-ROC |
|---------------------------|-----------|--------|----------|----------|---------|
| Logistic Regression (Bayes) | 0.113     | 0.780  | 0.197    | 0.358    | 0.814   |
| Random Forest (Bayes)       | 0.116     | 0.660  | 0.198    | 0.341    | 0.796   |
| XGBoost (Bayes)             | 0.168     | 0.520  | 0.254    | 0.366    | 0.791   |

üß† **Final Model:** XGBoost was selected for its high F2 score (0.366) and balanced precision-recall trade-off.

Note: Probabilities rarely exceed 60% due to the class imbalance (~5% stroke cases). A prediction of 40‚Äì60% is still meaningful.

## Sample Code Snippet

```python
def make_prediction(model, input_df, column_order):
    df_encoded = pd.get_dummies(input_df)
    df_encoded = df_encoded.reindex(columns=column_order, fill_value=0)
    return model.predict_proba(df_encoded)[0, 1]
```
